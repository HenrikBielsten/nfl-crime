This is a React application made for an assignment as part of a React course at YRGO, Gothenburg.

The app uses the NFL Arrest API (http://nflarrest.com/api/) to fetch information about the different NFL teams crime rates.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
